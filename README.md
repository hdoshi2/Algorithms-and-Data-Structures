To get started:

* `npm install`
* `npm start`

This will start a small http server, which will serve up the index.html file, as well as any "static resources" (that is, CSS and JS files, as well as fonts) that the index.html requests (via `link` and `script` tags). You can view the page by opening `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser!
